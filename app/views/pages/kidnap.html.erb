<h1> Oh no! StratIQue has kidnapped your daughter!</h1> 

<h1> I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom, I can tell you I don't have money. 
 <br> But what I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. 
 <br> 
 Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. 
 <br> 
 If you let my daughter go now, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you.  <br> 
 But if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will use SQL on you.</h1>
